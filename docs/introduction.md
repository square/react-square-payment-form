## Taking a Payment with Square

Taking online payments with Square is a 2-step process:

1. **[Generate a nonce](paymentform.md)**: Securely collect credit card & digital wallet information using the Square Payment Form and generate a nonce.
2. **[Charge the nonce](payments.md)**: Call Square's [CreatePayment](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/api/connect/v2#endpoint-payments-createpayment) endpoint with the amount, location ID, and nonce on your backend server.

A **nonce** is an encrypted token that lets you take payments with Square without handling real credit card numbers. It is generated by the payment form and holds information to identify the payment tender for an online payment. The generated nonce is used with Square's [Payments API](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/payments-api/overview) to create charges.
