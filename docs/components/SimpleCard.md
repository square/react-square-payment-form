Renders a placeholder element for the single-element payment form. The SqPaymentForm JS library will replace this element with
a secure `<iframe>` tag that will render a form.

When accepting credit card payments, you **must** have this component inside your `SquarePaymentForm`.

Cannot be used with digital wallets.
