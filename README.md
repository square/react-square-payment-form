# DEPRECATED - react-square-payment-form

**⛔️ SqPaymentForm is deprecated and will no longer be supported. Please use the [Web Payments SDK](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/web-payments/overview) to take payments on a web client. To migrate from the Square Payment Form to the Web Payments SDK, see the [Migrate to the Web Payments SDK](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/web-payments/migrate) migration guide.**

The React Square Payment Form lets you take payments securely and easily
in your React app using a familiar, component-based syntax.

## Compatability
